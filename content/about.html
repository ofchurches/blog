<h3>The past</h3>
<p>I completed my PhD at the <a href="https://www.autismresearchcentre.com/people_Churches">Univeristy of Cambridge</a> in 2011 and until 2017, I was a neuroscientist. There is a good list of my academic publications <a href="https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=nTXN-X8AAAAJ&amp;hl=en">here</a>. I quite enjoyed a lot about being an academic. I did some lectures where I lead the class in protest against the tyranny of frequentist statistics<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>:</p>

<p>And I was sometimes joined for lectures by a virtual teaching assistant.</p>

<h3>The present</h3>
<p>I am a statistician working for the Government of South Australia. I started this job in 2017. I provide analyses of administrative data for internal government communications and public facing data visualisations.</p>
<p>I also provide advice to government on the use of quantitative information including the construction of automated decision making systems. My work in this field led me to a <a href="https://www.churchilltrust.com.au/fellows/detail/4329/Owen+Churches">Churchill Fellowship</a> in 2019 to look at ethical and just regulation of artificial intelligences.</p>
<p>I still collaborate with the <a href="http://www.cain.science/">CAIN Laboratory</a> at UniSA. The beautiful knitted neurons on the landing page of this blog were made by the staff and students there.</p>
