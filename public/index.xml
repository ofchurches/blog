      <description>Background I joined the public service in 2017. Pretty soon after I started my boss and new colleagues suggested that the most important thing for me to read would be the legislation that I work under1.

      <description>TL;DR  Public sector statistician Former neuroscienctist   Long version The past I completed my PhD at the Univeristy of Cambridge in 2011 and until 2017, I was a neuroscientist.

  And I was sometimes joined for lectures by a virtual teaching assistant.</description>
