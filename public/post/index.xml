      <description>Background I joined the public service in 2017. Pretty soon after I started my boss and new colleagues suggested that the most important thing for me to read would be the legislation that I work under1.

      <description>Background When we look for a film to watch on Netflix, the interface we see presents us not with an open list of all the movies stored on the service but rather with a curated, personal set of recommendations for films. Similar processes guide us to find food to eat, friends to meet and lead us toward our choices whenever we interact withe the world through an online platform.</description>
